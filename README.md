# LC3 VM
An implementation of an LC3 VM in Rust, roughly following [this tutorial](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/).

Used this project as a way to learn rust, so expect awful code style :)

## Getting Started
```
cargo run <path-to-lc3-binary>
```

Test programs can be found in the [tutorial](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/)'s introduction.
